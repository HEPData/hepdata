            <p>Our website uses cookies to distinguish you from other users of our website. This helps us to provide you
                with a
                good experience when you browse our website and also allows us to improve our website. We use three types
                of cookies on
                our website. The first is for maintaining information about your session (required for login functionality).
                The second is required for analytics and performance from Google. The third is required to enable reCAPTCHA
                to protect the site from automated signups.
            </p>

            <h3>What is a cookie?</h3>
            <p>
                A cookie is a small text file that is placed on a user's computer hard drive by a website. There are
                several types
                of cookie and the most common are often referred to as session cookies. These are used to keep track of
                information
                needed by a user as they travel from page to page within a website. These cookies have a short lifetime
                and expire
                within a few minutes of the user leaving the website.
                Other types of cookies can be used to track internet activity after the user has left a website. These
                are usually
                sponsored by organisations external to the website being visited and are generally known as third-party
                cookies.
                These usually have a long lifetime with several months being quite common. They are 'harvested' and
                'refreshed'
                whenever the user visits a page where the same or a similar cookie is being used.
                We use the following cookies on this website:

            <ul>
                <li>SecureToken: a session cookie used for the secure maintenance of a signed-in user;</li>
                <li>Google Analytics cookies; and</li>
                <li>Google reCAPTCHA cookies.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Third party cookies</h3>
            <p>We use Google Analytics to maintain usage stats of the website.
                These stats are anonymous and only provide information with respect to the browser you are using,
                operating system, etc. and help us improve the site's performance across different platforms.</p>

            <p>We use Google reCAPTCHA v2 to protect the site from automated signups. When a user accesses the sign up page,
                reCAPTCHA analyzes user data such as IP address, mouse movements, time spent on the website; this data is
                transferred to Google, and is used to determine whether the user is a human being or a bot.</p>

            <p>See Google's <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> for more details about
                the data collected by Google.</p>

            <h3>Blocking and deleting</h3>
            <p>
                Internet browsers normally accept cookies by default; however, it is possible to set a browser to reject
                cookies. If
                this is done it is important not to exclude the benign and useful session cookies.
                Please note that this may impact on the usability of ours and other websites.</p>
