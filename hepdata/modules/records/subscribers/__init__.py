The watcher module provides the functionality to watch/unwatch queries.
Its main use case is to watch a record, so in this case the type would be
inspire_id, and the value would be the inspire id, e.g. 1231121. But this
can also be a collaboration, a reaction, an observable, etc. Then, to determine updates
over the past week, we just do a query on OpenSearch.
