*comment: CERN-LHC.  Measurements of the cross section for ZZ production using the 4l and 2l2nu decay channels in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV with 4.6 fb^-1 of data collected in 2011.  The final states used are 4 electrons, 4 muons, 2 electrons and 2 muons, 2 electrons and missing transverse momentum, and 2 muons and missing transverse momentum (MET).

The cross section values reported in the tables should be multiplied by a factor of 1.0141 to take into account the updated value of the integrated luminosity for the ATLAS 2011 data taking period.  The uncertainty on the global normalisation ("Lumi") remains at 1.8%.  See Eur.Phys.J. C73 (2013) 2518 for more details.

The 4l channel fiducial region is defined as:
- 4e, 4mu or 2e2mu
- Ambiguities in pairing are resolved by choosing the combination that results in the smaller value of the sum |mll - mZ| for the two pairs, where mll is the mass of the dilepton system.
- ptLepton > 7 GeV (at least one with ptLepton > 20 (25) GeV for muons (electrons))
- |etaLepton| < 3.16
- At least one lepton pair is required to have invariant mass between 66 and 116 GeV. If the second pair also satisfies this, the event is ZZ, otherwise if the second pair satisfies mll > 20 GeV it is ZZ*.
- min(DeltaR(l,l)) > 0.2.

The 2l2nu channel fiducial region is defined as:
- 2e+MET or 2mu+MET
- ptLepton > 20 GeV
- |etaLepton| < 2.5
- mll must be between 76 and 106 GeV
- -MET*cos(phi_METZ)>75 GeV, where phi_METZ is the angle between the Z and the MET
- |MET - pTZ| / pTZ < 0.4, where pTZ is the transverse momentum of the dilepton system
- No events with a jet for which ptJet > 25 GeV and |etaJet| < 4.5
- No events with a third lepton for which ptLepton > 10 GeV
- min(DeltaR(l,l)) > 0.3

# Remainder of file provides information on each table.  All records should
# have at least one table, even for single-number measurements where all
# relevant information is given in the abstract.

# Note that much of the HepData notation is historical and originates from
# 1970s guidelines for use with the Berkeley Database Management System (BDMS):
#   http://hepdata.cedar.ac.uk/resource/EncodingManual.pdf
# You can look at existing HepData records to get some idea of the format.
# LaTeX mathematical expressions are now supported via MathJax.

*location: Page 17 of preprint

# Comments on this particular table.  This is generally close to the caption of
# the associated figure/table in the paper, but it should not refer to missing
# information such as theoretical predictions (unless they are also given as
# numbers in the table).  A full stop is automatically inserted at the end of
# the dscomment, so it should be omitted here.
*dscomment: The measured fiducial cross sections.  The first systematic uncertainty is the combined systematic uncertainty excluding luminosity, the second is the luminosity

# The main process under study, used by the online search facility.
# The *reackey can be omitted if there is not a specific process.
# Multiple *reackey processes can be given on separate lines.
# Do not attempt to give multiple processes on the same line.
# Omit the decay products or give them on a separate line.
*reackey: P P --> Z0 Z0 X
# The reaction should always have an initial state and a final state
# separated by "-->".  The right-hand side should usually have an "X" to
# indicate an inclusive reaction (as opposed to exclusive where all
# final-state particles are known, e.g. elastic proton scattering).

# The particular type of measurement or observable, used by the online search.
# Use "SIG" for a cross section, "DSIG/DPT" for a differential cross section,
# "N" for number of events, etc.  See:  http://hepdata.cedar.ac.uk/browse
# Avoid adding new values not already in the database, found by browsing 
# or searching for "obs OBSKEY" on the main HepData webpage.  If in doubt,
# just omit the *obskey statement completely.  The *obskey value must consist
# of only a single word, but multiple values can be given on separate lines.
*obskey: SIG

# There are usually multiple lines beginning with "*qual:" giving the reaction
# (as below), the centre-of-mass energy, and important kinematic cuts.
# Here, the three columns of the table correspond to different final states.
# Decay products of the final-state particles are indicated by angular brackets.
*qual: RE : P P --> Z0 < LEPTON+ LEPTON- > Z0 < LEPTON+ LEPTON- > X : P P --> Z0 < LEPTON+ LEPTON- > Z0* < LEPTON+ LEPTON- > X : P P --> Z0 < LEPTON+ LEPTON- > Z0 < NU NUBAR > X

# Headers for the x columns separated by colons ":" (only one in this case).
*xheader: SQRT(S) IN GEV 

# Headers for the y columns separated by ":" (here, header spans three columns).
*yheader: SIG(fiducial) IN FB

# The *xheader and *yheader should always be present and should describe the
# quantities in the table.  Generally these will correspond to the labels of
# the x and y axis of the corresponding plot in the paper.  Qualifiers (*qual)
# are optional and can distinguish results given in different columns.  Always
# try to give the units of any variable that appears in the qualifiers or
# headers in the form "name IN units".  Each table should usually contain a
# qualifier giving the centre-of-mass energy (unless it appears as the x
# variable), e.g. "*qual: SQRT(S)/NUCLEON IN GEV : 7.7".

# Specify number of columns separated by ":" (here, 1 "x" and 3 "y" columns).
*data: x : y : y : y 

# Now give the numerical values for the data, separating columns by a
# semicolon (";") and also terminating each line by a semicolon (";").
# Non-existent entries can be indicated by dashes "-".
# Numerical values should be given with an appropriate and not excessive number
# of significant figures (in general, a maximum of 4), avoiding giving more
# decimal places for the errors than the central values.
# After the central value, give the statistical uncertainties followed by the
# (possibly multiple) systematic uncertainties in brackets as shown below.
# A label can be given to distinguish multiple systematic uncertainties, as
# shown below for the "lumi" case, by a colon after the number, then the label.
# For asymmetric errors, always give the "plus" error before the "minus" error.
# Note that "plus" and "minus" can refer to "up" and "down" variations of the
# source of uncertainty, and do not necessarily match the sign of the resultant
# uncertainty on the measurement (which can change sign along a distribution).
